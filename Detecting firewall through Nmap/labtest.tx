This lab is created by ghanimah in order to capture the flag. 

NOTE: TAKE PERMISSION BEFORE USE NMAP TO YOUR CUSTOMER IN ORDER TO SCAN ANY WEB APPLICATION.

Detecting Firewalls 
The Nmap TCP ACK scan (-sA) will establish whether packets can pass through your firewall unfiltered. To speed up the scan, the â€“n option can be used to prevent reverse DNS resolution on the active IP addresses it finds

sudo nmap -sA 34.69.76.124 -p 21 --reason

IMPORTANT:If firewall is unblock it will show result as unfiltered and you will analazye in wireshark packets. 
otherwise,if firewall is block it will show filtered then no activity show in wireshark.
