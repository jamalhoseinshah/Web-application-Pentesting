# Web-application-Pentesting

Web application penetration testing (WAPT) is a method of identifying and preventing Web Application Security Issues. WAPT involves the use and understanding of Web App vulnerabilities, tools, techniques, and procedures to identify security issues in Web Applications that might be exploitable for malicious purposes by hackers or other unauthorized individuals. Web applications are programs designed to run on web servers such as Internet Information Services (IIS), Apache Tomcat, etc. They can range from simple text-based calculators all the way up to complex eCommerce solutions like Amazonâ€™s Marketplace Platform; which includes many different services running together at once: authentication systems, databases, websites, and more.
