SQL injection usually occurs when you ask a user for input, like their username/userid, and instead of a name/id, the user gives you an SQL statement that you will unknowingly run on your database. Look at the following example which creates a SELECT statement by adding a variable (txtUserId) to a select string.
Attached snapshot by simple formula "or "1"="1 , Its will get results of all user exsist in the web application database.
